Comp 20: Web Programming


-What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
	This repository represents the work that I've done for my Web Programming course at Tufts University. In total, there are 6 completed projects: 

	1. Karaoke: a web page to annotate lyrics for a music video
	2. MMap: a Marauder's Map-type project that utilizes the Google Maps API to pinpoint the geolocation of students and their relative distances from set landmarks.
	3. Newsfeed: a dynamically updated newsfeed, similar to Facebook.
	4. Responsive: a web page that updates the image shown based on the size of the browser window.
	5. Security: an assessment of another student's "Where in the World" project that highlights web security issues and proposes resolutions for those issue.
	6. Where in the World: a server-side web application built using MongoDB, NodeJS, and Express, hosted on Heroku, that features 3 APIs to record and summarize geolocation and logind data for users.


-What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	My favorite assignment was Where in the World, because I got to piece all of my skills about web applications and server-side development together to create a cohesive application. It pushed the boundaries of my knowledge of web programming so that I could discover and implement a working app, with no previous experience of NodeJS or Express. 


-How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	Based on the all the skills I've acquired over the course of the semester, I believe I have grown exponentially. Going into this course, I knew absolutely nothing about web programming - now I have created work using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, JSON, AJAX, MongoDB, NodeJS, and Express, including utilizing external resources to aid developmment such as Bootstrap, Heroku, and Google APIs. I think my growth is immeasurable, as I consider myself to be a competent web programmer upon completion of this course.


-What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	The most important thing I learned in this course was how to look for help. Most of the projects in this repository were assigned without giving much technical background to support their development, which meant that in order to successfully implement them, I had to clearly define my problems in order to ask the appropriate questions. I utilzied the help of my peers more than anything, as we were all learning this as we went along and everyone had different strengths they could contribute to help each other out. Knowing what to search for on the web with regards to documentation for different APIs and coding techniques was also extremely important, as there is a vast sea of information about web development on the web that can be overwhelming if you don't focus on your particular problems.


-Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	I would love to dive deeper into web design (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap) and web security. These topics were touched on briefly in this course, while a number of our projects honed our JavaScript and coding skills, but I would love to be proficient in client-side design and security.
