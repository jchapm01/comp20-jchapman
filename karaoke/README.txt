Lab 5: "The six o'clock alarm would never ring"
10/9/2014

1. I implemented everything correctly (only using JavaScript in index.html): index.html and style.css. Each verse appears as a whole paragraph at the right time in the song.
The only thing I'm missing are the 2 images to help annotate it - I couldn't get the rest of my HTML to display both the lyrics and the images at the same time.

2. Collaborated with: Jared Bronen, Matt O'Conor

3. Approx hours = 3
