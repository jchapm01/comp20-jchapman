Assignment 2: Marauder's Map
Jessie Chapman

1. Everything is definitely not implemented correctly...rendering the markers and polylines for the characters isn't working, and I haven't gotten to making the markers for the students yet.
2. BIG UPS to Jared Bronen and Scott Jacobson to helping a girl out on which javascript functions to call in what order since it's asynchronous/how to go through the JSON using a dictionary/sorted list to get the characters' info.
3. Still working on it
