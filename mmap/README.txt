Assignment 2: Marauder's Map
Jessie Chapman

1. Everything is definitely not implemented correctly...stuck on getting the JSON request and getting the map to pan to my location
2. BIG UPS to Jared Bronen and Scott Jacobson to helping a girl out on which javascript functions to call in what order since it's asynchronous
3. Still working on it
