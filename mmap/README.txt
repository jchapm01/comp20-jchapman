Assignment 2: Marauder's Map
Jessie Chapman

1. Everything is definitely not implemented correctly...got my icon to render/have the map pan to me, now just need to use the parsed JSON to render the characters/player's locations, get the lines between me and characters working, and make an info window
2. BIG UPS to Jared Bronen and Scott Jacobson to helping a girl out on which javascript functions to call in what order since it's asynchronous
3. Still working on it
