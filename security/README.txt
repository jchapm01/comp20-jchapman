NOTE 12/5/2014- I finished this assignment on time, but I COMPLETELY forgot to push everything to my github last night. Technically this is a day late but I just remembered that I didn't push everything on time!!

1. Everything is complete.
2. Did not collaborate with anyone in class; Brendan Conron helped with ideas for different types of attacks I could perform on this app.
3. Approx hours spent: ~2
